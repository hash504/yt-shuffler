# YouTube Shuffler

This website was created because i got tired of dealing with YouTube's sucky playlist shuffle system.

## Features

* A URL bar for adding playlists to the website
* A section for viewing the title and channel of each playlist's video, including a link to the video on YouTube
* A search bar for finding videos in the playlist listing section
* A video player for playing playlist videos, with Start, Reset, Pause/Play and Next Video buttons
* A Priority Setter, which allows you to have a higher chance of encountering a certain video when shuffling, or re-adding a video after it's been shuffled

## Features To-Do-List

* The Previous Video button
* The ability to set the video from the playlist list (not very likely to be added due to difficulty)

## Additional Info

This website was made for shuffling through music-focused playlist, it wasn't made for viewing individual videos,
so features like sending a video from the playlist list section to the video player and additional controls for the player won't be implemented.
